This JSON file is a compilantion of every unit available via datasheets given by GW to download for free.
It was extracted using the PDF files, and some crazy PHP code to organize everything.
This is something that anyone could do using regexp and php shaenanigans.

If there is any error, omissions or mistakes, please make them known so I can correct them for the next estractions, this file will de updates constantly with the changes of the files as time goes by.

If you want to use it in a project of your own feel free to do so.
Also consider buying me a cofee:
