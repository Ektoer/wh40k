# WH40K 10th Ed. - Units
This JSON file is a compilation of every unit available via datasheets given by GW to download for free.
It was extracted using the PDF files, and some crazy PHP code to organize everything.
This is something that anyone could do using regexp and php shaenanigans.

If there are any errors, omissions or mistakes, please make them known so I can correct them for the next extraction, this file will be updated constantly with the changes of the files given by GW.

Roadmap:
- Planning on adding the points cost from the Munitorum so this can be also used to build armies.
- Planning on improving the Wargear options, and unit composition.

If you want to use it in a project of your own feel free to do so.
Also consider buying me a cofee:
