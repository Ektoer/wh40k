# WH40K 10th Ed. - Units
This JSON file is a compilation of every unit available via datasheets given by GW to download for free.
It was extracted using the PDF files, and some crazy PHP code to organize everything.
This is something that anyone could do using regexp and php shaenanigans.

If there are any errors, omissions or mistakes, please make them known so I can correct them for the next extraction, this file will be updated constantly with the changes of the files given by GW.

##Changelog
- Corrected, clasified and sortes abilities to be used as [name,effect]
- Added schema.json so anyone that want to add information knows how to.
  
Roadmap for the future:
- Add the points cost from the Munitorum so this can be also used to build armies.
- Improvemproving the Wargear options, and unit composition.
- Adding Forgeworld Datasheets.

If you want to use it in a project of your own feel free to do so.
